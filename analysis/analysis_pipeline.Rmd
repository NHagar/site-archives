```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

##Load in data
```{r}

```

##Transform raw data to measures
It would be cool to do this all in one block. Not sure if my R skills are up for that though. 

Measures we decided on:
* Story count
* Bylines
* Sections
* Tags (active)
* Stories per byline
* Byline duration
* Story length - classification
* In/out link ratio
* Image credits
* Quotes/excerpts
* Story rate per day
* Clickbait in headlines
```{r}

```
